<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I'm <strike>14</strike> 15 years old, and enjoy computer. My first tool for learning about computers was an iPod Touch, 4th generation. I was homeschooled in 7th grade, and guess what? That's really where this story begins. So I basically spent eight months on a computer. That was when I hit my all-time low, which I believe contributed to me hitting my all-time high. As I did my school work, I would often tinker around with my iPod. I found some ways to impliment "Jailbreak tweaks" into it, despite it being "jailed".</p>
<p>I eventually jailbroke it, which ended up giving me an interest in coding. I changed how it looked, and even made it appear to run iOS 7, even though that model only goes to iOS 6.1.3.</p>
<p>Of course, spending a year away from people, I lost vital social skills. I was very awkward around people until about halfway through that next school year. I'm certainly not very high on the social roster(?), but if the world ever collapses into an apocalypse involving computer, I'm sure to survive.</p>
<p>In eighth grade, things were going great. I had a group of friends, and met one of my-now greatest friends.<p>
<p>High School rolls around. Great. It wasn't as bad as I thought. I was reunited with friends from elementary school, <span style="font-size:xx-small">and someone else,</span> so things were <strike>okay</strike> pretty great. I lost connections with some of my friends from eighth grade, though. So that sucks.<p>
