<h2>February 3, 2015</h2>
&nbsp
<p>This is harder than it looks. I've been trying forever to find a decent FTP server to host this on, for free. In fact, at time of writing, I don't have a working domain.</p>
&nbsp
<p>I'm using a VPN at school to connect my phone to my FTP server, to connect to my dropbox, which currently contains my website files.</p>
<p> It isn't going very well.</p>
&nbsp
<p>anyway, back to about me.<p/>
<p>actually, I could create a subdomain here with all the excess info. It wouldn't be a bad idea.</p>
<p>before I do that, I'm going to make a banner at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>There we go. It looks like crap, but oh well.</p>
<h2>February 5, 2015</h2>
<p>Fixed it. It's now locked to the top of the screen, which would be nice if I actually had enough content to scroll.</p>
<p>I've also added a webpage view tracker.<p>
<p>As of now, I'm already at 83 views from myself.</p>
<h2>April 22, 2016</h2>
<p>It's ben about half a month since I last worked on the site. I seriously need to find a remote server-</p>
<p>I am a freaking idiot</p>
<p>I've been using Github for some other projects, and never even considered using it for this.</p>
<p>Why must I be like this?</p>
