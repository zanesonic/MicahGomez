<h2>General Update [#3]<span style="font-size:x-small"> April 22, 2016</span></h2>
<p>Well, this may be going online very soon. I just figured out how to host this online. See <a href="../progress/main.html">her</a>.</p>
<h2>General Update [#2]<span style="font-size:x-small"> March 30, 2016</span></h2>
<p>April first is on friday, so you know what that means. I'm currently trying to figure out a decent prank to pull. I've discarded the pop-its under the toilet seat; too many people heard about it. Instead, I'm going to log onto someone else's computer, take a screenshot of their homescreen, set it as the wallpaper, put their desktop icons in a folder in C:, and hide the dock. It's going to be hilarious to watch. If you haven't caught on, it makes it seem like their computer isn't responding. My birthday is also in 17 days, which happens to be a <span style="font-size:x-small">certain</span> friend's birthday as well. Which has led to some rather amusing jokes <span style="font-size:x-small">and perhaps pickup lines</span>. It would be awkard if that friend found this ever... If you think its you, <span style="font-size:x-large">It's not</span>. It's uh... my other friends just like you.</p>
<p>Wow, I'm really confiding a lot in the internet. In probably a month's worth of updates, you'll probably be able to tell who my <span style="font-size:x-small">certain</span> friend is just walking past <strike>her</strike> <span style="font-size:x-large">them</span> on the sidewalk. Joy.</p>
<p>Fin.</p>
<h2>First post - Spring break! [#1]<span style="font-size:x-small"> March 28, 2016</span></h2>
<p>Took me long enough. Just got back from spring break, which was pretty dull. A week before that though, I went on a cruise around the Bahamas. I boarded the second largest cruise ship <span style="font-size:x-large">in the world</span>. I met a lot of people, and even got a really good-looking girl's number. I fell really behind in my school work though. So I need to catch up. I should probaby be working rather than typing. Oh well. Can't fix that now. I'll put pictures in a collage below. That is, if I can get a picture uploaded. Scratch that, I'll get one later.</p>
